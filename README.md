# Healt-life-project

This project is an app about recipes, where users can search and select specific recipes from search results, adjust the number of servings, and save their favorite recipes as bookmarks.

By working on this project, I had the opportunity to practice using many modern features such as OOP, classes, modules, promises, async/await, and I learned why it's important to think about error handling in order to provide a good user experience.

I learned about the importance of project architecture. I used the MVC architecture and realized why it is important to have a structured code to better organize and maintain it. This allows for easier changes in the future or adding new features. I understood that by using the MVC architecture, the project becomes more clear and easier to maintain, which is crucial for successful development and long-term success of the project.

In this project, I also confirmed and improved my skills by using various features. Additionally, implementing pagination was a challenging task, but I learned how it works and used that knowledge in another project where I implemented it on my own.

In this prject I used JavaScript, Sass and HTML5
